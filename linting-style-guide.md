# Linting and Style Guide Checks
Linters use static analysis to check for inconsistencies in the use of various language features.
They provide warnings and errors useful for debugging these issues, which may include incorrect usage of language features.

Style Guide checkers make sure that your code adheres to popularly recognized style guides.
This encourages consistent coding, making your code easier to read and understand.
