# Code Visualization Tools
The following tools can show visual indications of the call graphs and other useful properties to help debug
more complex interactions in a smart contract system.

## ethereum-graph-debugger ([link](https://github.com/fergarrui/ethereum-graph-debugger))
A graphical EVM debugger. Displays the entire program control flow graph.

## Slither ([link](https://github.com/trailofbits/slither))
Slither can map method visibility and modifiers, state variables that are read and written, calls, and can print the inheritance graph of a smart contract

## Solgraph ([link](https://github.com/raineorshine/solgraph))
Generates DOT graphs with function control flow of a solidity contract

## Surya ([link](https://github.com/ConsenSys/surya))
Generates various visual outputs of function call graphs

## sol-function-profiler ([link](https://github.com/EricR/sol-function-profiler))
Solidity contract function profiler
