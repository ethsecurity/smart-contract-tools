# Disassemblers and Reverse Engineering Tools
Heavy-duty, low-level tools that assist understanding and working with compiled bytecode for the EVM.
Security professionals typically use these tools to discover defects with on-chain deployments, compillers,
and other low-level tools, as well as to assist in auditing other complex smart contracts and tools.
